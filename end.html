            I cannot believe I have done all this. I feel so proud of what I have achieved. I know it needs some work to be done for it
            to be complete and polished but this is far from what I could of imagined. It's crazy to think that all those hours really 
            paid off. 
         </p>

            I cannot help but want to keep adding to this project. After the Note section, I swear I had lost all creative drive.
            But as time passes and I edit this, I have once again been filled with ideas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As you know, you only got those 5 pages, this one being just a page for ranting (does not count). I could have added more 
            content to those pages but I didn't. All the new ideas did not seem to fit well with what I had. It kind of felt like 
            I was trying to add new stuff to an old chapter if that makes sense. As I am polishing this, it does feel like a chapter is coming to an 
            end. I wonder how you feel now that you have reached the end the project. Is it just me or is this kind of sad? 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the time being, I think I am going to be taking a break from creating after I finish this up. I really have to get back and focus on 
            school. So as for the ideas I have now, I will have to hold on to them and apply them in a new project. 
        </p>
        <p>Now back to editing.</p>

            This project was truely a pleasure to do. I had my moments where I almost just left the project undone. But I pushed myself to 
            finish it. I couldn't just keep this in the drafts after all those hours of hard work right? Anyways, I had trouble publishing the 
            website this time around. But after trial and error I got it to publish properly. So by a little, you almost did not end up with 
            a project to even see. I swear if it wasn't one thing not working, it was another. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you did not notice, this page is pretty bland. Since this is just me ranting as I am editing I did not think it needed anything fancy
            done to it. Also, I have no urge of editing another well structured page. So take this as a mini behind the scenes post I suppose. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll see if I have anymore thoughts before sending this your way. If I don't, I guess this is goodbye.
