            <i>As I am editing, I got the idea of adding a page that acts as a journal. A place to simply write my thoughts
            as I edit the website. You do not have to read this. I only added this as a point of reference for what is going 
            on or what was going on in my end. So you can ignore all this or read it if you like. It's up to you.

            I had tried publishing the website last night to see what I am working with and came across a problem that 
            has taken me hours to solve. I spend a good portion of today trying to figure out why the website was not 
            showing properly. I almost threw the whole project away because of it. I thought maybe that was my sign
            to stop all this. To not finish it. By some miracle, I got it to work. And now 
            I am able to see what needs fixing. 
            <br><br>
            I honestly cannot believe I have done all this. That I made this website. It needs some work for it
            to be complete but this is far from what I could have imagined. It's crazy to think that all those hours really 
            paid off. 
            <br><br>
            I cannot help but want to keep adding to this project. After the Note section, I swear I had lost all creative drive.
            But as time passes and I edit this, I have once again been filled with ideas. But making any major chances at this 
            stage feels wrong. It feels like a chapter is closing and all the new ideas don't fit in. So I will not be changing much of the content 
            unless necessary. I also must not add anything new either. This project needs to come to an end. I cannot let my mind
            keep creating.
            <br><br>
             As I reach the end of the day, I am not even close to done with editing. I thought it was only going to take me about 
             two days. My luck&#128557; After I finish this, I'm definitely taking a break from creating&#128514;
            <br><br>
            If you had not noticed, this page is bland. I considered decorating it but with all that I have in my plate I've decided not to. After all
            this is just me ranting. And I'm tired&#128557;
        </p>

        <p>
            I am again questioning whether or not I should finish this project. I can't just keep this in the drafts after all those hours of hard work&#128557; AH.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working on the Note page and oh my god I am having issues with it again. What are the odds. 
            The music player is not displaying entirely or properly on Chrome and smaller devices for some reason. 
            I've had to scrap that whole music player and come up with something new. I've added a different way to
            get access to the music that I am happy with but I am disappointed that after hours of trying to fix the music 
            player I ended up having to scrap it :/
            <br><br>
            There are only two sections that need work with responsiveness. Lets hope I can get those right.
            <br><br>
            Update: It's night time and I have finally finished cleaning up the responsiveness of the website to the best
            of my abilities. Now all that is left is the content. I'm almost done. Thank GOD&#128514; Nah man what 
            was I thinking when I started this &#128557;&#128514;
            <br><br>

           As I edit the content of these 5 pages, I see now how much I had journaled in them. I am writing as if I am the 
           sole reader. And that is not the case. This is not a journal for my own consumption. This is a website for your
           entertainment. 
          <br><br>
           I find that my perspective has evolved and what was written in the start no longer fits the websites tone. 
           Good thing 
           I am still editing because I don't want a repeat of the previous website. Which now
           that we're on the topic, I would like to mention something.  
           <br><br>
           It took me a full day to draft out each page (not including this one). It's day 4 of editing the website's content, 
           look and responsiveness but so far a lot has been fixed so far. Whenever I finish editing, 
           I am planning on sitting on the project before sending it your way. 
           Why? Well, I want to make sure everything written still holds true.
            I do not want to sent you something I am going to regret. The last website took me 
            two days to draft and complete. Out of impulse, I sent it a little too early. I was excited
            for you to see the project that I had forgotten why I even created it in the first place.
            <br><br>
            So the content has changed through out even though I said I wouldn't change it. There are things 
            that make sense at the time of writing but once I sit on them I find they lose their power.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I reach the end of editing I feel a little sad. I know I could just reach out to you through 
            text but it just does not seem right. This feels right. I don't know. 
            <br><br> 
            The difference with this project and the previous one is evident. And I don't know if I should 
            be upset for what I did with the other project. But without one, there wouldn't be the one. One 
            was the stepping stone needed. But was it worth it?
            <br><br>
            So what happens now? I'll have to wait and see. In a day or two I'll come back
            and make the decision whether to send this or not. Doubt is setting in. So I don't know
            what is to come.

            I went out on a walking yesterday and tell me why my mind decided it was time to do some thinking. "Just text her,"my mind said.
            "Why are you making it weird." I've considered that before. But I'm not normal so here we are&#128514; No, it feels weird. I think
            I'm just scared to do so as well. I don't know. I had said you could reach if you wanted to so I am just following your lead. I mean, also, that 
            last project did not leave a door for you or me to reach out to one another. So even if you or I wanted to reach out it would just
            be and feel weird. I suppose I hope this project bridges that gap and makes things easier for us if there is a want to continue a friendship. 
            I don't know.  I am not expecting anything. I don't do things expecting something. I do them simply because I want to do them. Nothing more.

            <br><br>
            I have added the final touches to this and I am actually happy with everything. But will I sent it? I don't know. Why is this so hard?
         </p>

          <p>
            I've sent it. What is there to lose?
