            <i>As I am editing, I got the idea of adding a page that acts as a journal. A place to simply write my thoughts
            as I edit the website. You do not have to read this. I only added this as a point of reference for what is going 
            on or what was going on in my end. So you can ignore all this or read it if you like. It's up to you.

            I had tried publishing the website last night to see what I am working with and came across a problem that 
            has taken me hours to solve. I spend a good portion of today trying to figure out why the website was not 
            showing properly. I almost threw the whole project away because of it. I thought maybe that was my sign
            to stop all this. To not finish it. By some miracle, I got it to work. And now 
            I am able to see what needs fixing. 
            <br><br>
            I honestly cannot believe I have done all this. That I made this website. It needs some work to be done for it
            to be complete but this is far from what I could have imagined. It's crazy to think that all those hours really 
            paid off. 
            <br><br>
            I cannot help but want to keep adding to this project. After the Note section, I swear I had lost all creative drive.
            But as time passes and I edit this, I have once again been filled with ideas. But making any major chances at this 
            stage feels wrong. It feels like a chapter is closing. All the new ideas feel like they do not 
            belong here. So I will not change much of the content 
            unless necessary. I must not add anything new either.
            <br><br>
             As I reach the end of the day, I am not even close to done with editing. I thought it was only going to take me about 
             two days. My luck&#128557; After I finish this, I'm definitely taking a break from creating&#128514;
            <br><br>
            If you had not noticed, this page is bland. I considered decorating it but with all that I have in my plate I've decided not to. After all
            this is just me ranting. And I'm tired&#128557;
        </p>

        <p>
            I am again questioning whether or not I should finish this project. I can't just keep this in the drafts after all those hours of hard work&#128557; AH.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently working on the Note page and oh my god I am having issues with it again. What are the odds. 
            The music player is not displaying entirely or properly on Chrome and smaller devices for some reason. 
            I've had to scrap that whole music player and come up with something new. I've added a different way to
            get access to the music that I am happy with but am disappointed that after hours of trying to fix the music 
            player I ended up having to scrap it :/
            <br><br>
            There are only two sections that need work with responsiveness. Lets hope I can get those right.
            <br><br>
            Update: It's night time and I have finally finished cleaning up the responsiveness of the website to the best
            of my abilities. Now all that is left is the content. I'm almost done. Thank GOD&#128514; Nah man what 
            was I thinking when I started this &#128557;&#128514;

           As I edit the content of these pages I see, now, how much I am journaling here. I am writing as if I am the 
            sole reader. And that is not the case. This is not a journal. This is a website. 
          <br><br>
           My perspective has evolved and what was written in the start is not fit for this website. Good thing 
           I am still editing because I don't want a repeat of the previous website. Which now
           that we're on the topic, I would like to mention something.  
           <br><br>
           It took me a full day to draft out each page (not including this one). It's day 4 of editing the website's content, 
           look and responsiveness. 
           I am planning on sitting on the project, once I finish editing it, before sending it your way. 
           Why? I want to 
           make sure everything written still holds true.
            I do not want to sent you something I am going to regret. The last website took me 
            two days to draft and complete. Out of impulse, I sent it a little too early. I was excited
            for you to see the project that I forgotten why I had even created it in the first place.

            As I reach the end of editing I feel a little sad. What started as a light-hearted project 
            feels like a full on stepping stone. Like what happens now? Will I actually send it? We'll see.
