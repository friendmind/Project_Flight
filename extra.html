            We've made it. The last page. The best for last. Just kidding. What was your favorite page?

            As you know there was more to this website than the previous one. More to play with. More thought and creative
            aspects to it.
            It's crazy to think that I had started 
            this whole project on a random night not knowing so much would come from it. 
            As I said in the beginning, this website was created with the intention of simply improving the previous website. 
            Now that we're here, we see how much my thought process changed.
            <br><br>
            The journey to this final version of the website was a rollercoaster. I, of course, had fun making this but there were
            moments where I was over it and was ready to keep it in the drafts. But you wanna know why I kept on working on it? 
            Because I was having too much fun to even care about the struggles and things that were trying to make me stop this insanity.
            Also, I had dedicated so much time into this I could not just walk away from it. 
            <br><br>
            Despite whatever set backs I had, seeing the end result, I couldn't be happier. I know I could have made things easier for myself
            by making this simple and short. But as you see, I love complicating things for myself&#128037; I'm just kidding&#128514; No, but really, every moment I spent on this was truely a joy. 
            So it is kind of sad knowing that this is it. The last page.

            I honestly hope that this project provided you with some sort of joy or comfort. That it 
            lightened or brightened your day even slightly.
            If you have made it this far, I assume you have enjoyed or been intrigued by all this. Whatever
            it might be, I am glad you are here. 
            <br><br>
            So this page I added not knowing what it would contain or be about. Actually, as you know I had no idea what 
            I was trying to go for with this website. I simply went on adding and removing as I went. Going based
            on what felt right and looked good to me. Each page being inspired by what I felt, thought and saw at 
            the given moment. This page is not any different from the previous ones. 
            
            <br><br>
          In fact, the concept for this page was inspired by a conversation we had. What could it be? You'll see.

        <h2 class="extra_h2">Update</h2>
        <p class="all_par extra_par" style="background-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.3);">
            Now, the following is an update on me. This was written not long after it occurred so you're getting something fairly new.
            As mentioned above, it has to do with something we had spoken about before. I thought to
            give you a heads up before throughing you into the Update. But now that you know this, you may continue.
        </p>
        <p class="all_par extra_par">
            A couple things have happened since the last time we've spoken. The main one being I got a hair
            cut. That might not be big news or anything but to me it is. As you know, I had wanted to cut my 
            hair. Actually, I don't even know if that is what I told you. I think I just said I didn't 
            trust my mom cutting my hair anymore. Anyways, I had told my sister, Edith, and our friend, Susan,
            if they would be down to go to the nail salon to get my hair cut. This nail salon is where they both
            get there nails done and where they happen to cut hair as well. Since it was a place that was familiar, 
            I was willing to go there to get a hair cut. I had pitched we should go there soon but we never set a date to go. 
            Fast-forward a week later, my sister shows up unexpectedly at my home
            and tells me if I am ready to go to the nail salon. I was caught off guard as by that time I had decided
            to grow out my hair. As you could imagine, I was struggling to make a decision. It was now or never my sister said. After
            a minute of deep thinking, I said fuck it and off we went. My older sister, Mariana, ended up tagging along
            as well. So we had the whole gang there: both of my sisters, Susan (our friend) and Nadia (Susan's daughter).
            <br><br> 
            I was nervous, of course, as I had not gotten my hair cut by someone other than my mom or away from home before. I 
            was also scared that they would mess up the hair cut. Which, if you remember, I had said I have had my hair cut bad before and 
            that I didn't mind getting a bad hair cut. Well, I was paying money this time around so my hair cut needed to come out good&#128557;&#128514; No, I'm playing. Good or bad hair cut, I was going 
            for the experience. If I didn't like 
            the hair cut I'd just grow it out.
            <br><br>
            So how did it go?
            Well, the first half of the hair cut was a breeze. I was excited after all. It 
            wasn't until she kept changing guards that I began to get nervous again. At some point, she took out an 
            electric razor that had a sharp blade and let me tell you she was going at it with it. She was doing things I have never experienced before when
            getting a hair cut so I was panicking a bit. But I told myself to trust the process. That she knows what she's 
            doing. Fast-forward to the end of the hair cut, I'm glad I trusted the process because I loved how it turned out.
            <br><br>
            Seeing myself in the mirror was a trip. I was like damn is that me?&#128514; Like for the first time I 
            actually got the hair cut I had asked for&#128514; Moving away from that, when everyone got the full hair cut reveal they treated it as if I had won the lottery or 
            something&#128514; They were all in shock and complimenting me on how good it looked. Even one of the workers chimed in and said I looked good and that short hair suited me.
            I was honestly happy that everyone shared the same joy I did. That we all liked the hair cut.
            So as you can see I had a great positive experience and 
            as you can expect, I will definitely be returning to the nail salon if I want a new hair cut&#128514;
            <br><br>
            As for the look, I really do look and feel different. Crazy what a hair cut can do to a person. 
            <br><br>
            Anyways, the only person who was 
            not happy with the look was my mom, which was expected. She has always preferred my hair long. 
            I didn't mind her reaction though. I was happy with my hair cut and that's all that matters.
