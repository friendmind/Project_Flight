             I started this website with the idea of playing around and testing out what I was learning from my 
             classes but as you will see things took a turn and now we're here. Without giving too much away, I had based the structure of 
             this website on the previous one. I had intentions of simply improving the last one to see how much could be 
             changed with what I had learned. I did not come in with the idea of sending this to you. But as I got to working on it
             I saw myself loving what I was doing too much and began to stray off from what was the initial plan.
             I had several moments of doubt from the beginning to end about sending you this website. So if you have received this 
             I have thought really hard if I should sent it to you or no. And I suppose you will go on to find out why.
             <br><br> 
             Since this is the main page, I have layed out what I think you should know before continuing. That is if you want to continue.
             You do not have to browse the website if you do not want to. You can just 
             ignore this whole thing. But if you have decided you want to continue. Read the following.
        </p>
        <div class="all_par main_par">
        <p>
            Some things you should consider before moving onto the following pages:
            <br><br>
            <ol >
                <li>You should consider looking at the website through your computer.
                    You may get something a little different when browsing through your computer that
                    gets missed when browsing through it on your phone.
                </li>
                <li>There will be interactive elements on this one so be on the look out for them as they
                    may not be as direct as some of them.</li>
                <li>Don't worry about the content the following pages will have. It will not be like the previous
                    one. You can say I have learned my lesson &#128037;
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: rgb(206, 178, 22);">Each page will be a different theme. For this reason, you must proceed to only access one page per day.</span></li> 
               <li>Lastly, 
                    <button  class="all_buttons"
                    onclick="alert('Have fun and enjoy it! You will see I have left commentary as I created the website. I will be jumping from past tense (current me, working on the website) and present tense. I\'m giving you a heads up in case things don\'t make sense at times.\n\nAs mentioned above, you can only view one page per day. Come back tomorrow to view the following section: Thoughts.')">
