             I started this website with the idea of playing around and testing out what I was learning from my 
             classes but as you will see things took a turn and now we're here. I did not start this project with the idea 
             of sending this to you. Actually, I didn't start this project with you even in mind. I had based the structure of 
             this website on the previous one with the intentions of simply improving it to see how much could be 
             changed with what I had learned. Without giving too much away,
             I saw myself loving what I was doing a little too much and began to stray off from what was the initial plan. I began 
             making something that I did not perceive. The moment I realized what was going on I couldn't
             stop myself from continuing. I was knee deep into it and could not pull out so easily. 
             <br><br>
             Just know I had several moments of doubt from the beginning to end about this website. Whether I should finish it and send it 
             your way. So if you have received this, it must be for a good reason. In fact, you will go on to find out what caused 
             me to send it to you, if you stick around.

             Since this is the main page, I want to give you the chance to decide whether or not you want to browse this website.
             I have layed out what I think you should know before continuing. They give you an idea of what lays ahead and the rules 
             you should consider following if you decide to proceed. 
             Just know you do not have to browse this website if you do not want to. You can
             ignore this whole thing. There is no issue. Whatever you decide, go ahead and read the following.
        </p>
        <div class="all_par main_par">
        <p>
            Some things you should consider before moving onto the following pages:
            <br><br>
            <ol >
                <li>You should consider looking at the website through your computer.
                    You may get something a little different when browsing through your computer that
                    gets missed when browsing through it on your phone.
                </li>
                <li>There will be interactive elements on this one so be on the look out for them as they
                    may not be as direct as some of them.</li>
                <li>Each page will be a different theme. For this reason, you must proceed to only access one page per day.</li> 
                <li>Don't worry about the content the following pages will have. It will not be like the previous
                    one. You can say I have learned my lesson &#128037;
                </li>
               <li>Lastly, 
                    <button  class="all_buttons"
                    onclick="alert('Have fun and enjoy it! You will see I have left commentary as I created this website. I will be jumping from past tense (current me, working on the website) and present tense. I\'m giving you a heads up in case things don\'t make sense at times.\n\nAs mentioned above, you can only view one page per day. Come back tomorrow to view the following section: Thoughts.')">
