            That is not the reason I am making this. You just happen to be the only person that has showed interest in this
            type of thing so it seemed right to send this your way. I mean I did make this with you in mind so as you can assume not anyone can see it. 
            But still, if I didn't think you would enjoy this type of thing I would not have created this and sent it your way.

                With everything I have done and am doing, I'm sure you think I am crazy. Like I'm sure you did not expect me to be like this at all. Or maybe you did. Maybe you had a hunch.
                Who knows.
                <br><br>
                The previous website I am sure was a lot. Again, most likely only adding to your plate. You must 
                have thought, "Damn I can't catch a break&#128514;" Or maybe you could have cared less. I don't 
                know. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I'm still working on not getting caught in that. It's hard at times. But I'm doing surprisingly well now. A small break through.">That is the thing with not knowing.</span> 
                
                <br><br>
                    You might see everything you have experienced the last couple weeks as new lore.
                    Experiences for you new character arc. You might be laughing at the obsurdity of all this. 
                    You might think I'm doing too much. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not? I don't know. 
                <br><br>
                Whatever thoughts or feelings derived from what I have done or am doing, are probably reasonable thoughts and feelings. 
                The decisions you have made, prior to this, were for a reason and I respect them despite not knowing the real reasoning behind them.

                     I sit here and can't help but wonder how different things would be if I were just normal. Like 
                    why am I like this. I mean I know why but still&#128514; Like we could have avoided all this if I had just 
                    not made it about me. If I hadn't gotten caught up with how I felt and fed into the thoughts I was having over everything.                   
                    <br><br>
                    I mentioned in the previous website that I am self-aware of myself. I saw what I did and knew I messed up before you even spoke up. You might have been able to brush it off
                    as you knew I didn't mean it in a bad way. But still, I couldn't bare knowing I made you feel some kind of way.
                    And for that reason I couldn't act like nothing happened and just move on.
                    <br><br>
                    The last website was my way of trying to make up or lessen the damage I had caused. It was
                    a space I created in hopes of clearing whatever was not clear or known. You know, I was afraid of not communicating and 
                    things being left as they were. So I created that website and sent it to you because that was far better than not doing anything at all and letting things play out on 
                    there own. We're adults after all. We don't have to sit back and do nothing. We have the decision to speak up and talk things out.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="Don't worry, I am fine now. It's normal for me to lose it here and there. So this isn't nothing new. I'm familiar with it. And I've learned how to handle these moments better.">You can say I spiraled a bit.</span> I had lost myself in what I thought you were thinking and feeling over what I said. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="It hurt seeing you sad. I felt your sadness and it felt like my own. This happens far to often. I try to not treat it as my own. But I sometimes cannot. ">I knew you were vulnerable. I saw that. I felt it.
                    </span> So knowing I stabbed at the wound you had...I just couldn't believe I had done that. That I had put you in such a position.
                    <br><br>
                    I don't know if the previous website had an impact on you. I don't know if I only made things worse. But I 
                    know I was trying to not leave you with what I said. 
                    I know I'm down to mess up somewhere and that does scare me. But that's life. We're not perfect after all. We will make mistakes. 
                    We will need to experience things 
                    to be able to challenge ourselves. To grow. For us to learn how to navigate unfamiliar territory. 
                    <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="All I am doing is with the mentality that I had hurt you. That is where all this is coming from.">
                    <br><br>
                    I know nothing I do and say justifies my actions but I do learn and I try to do better.</span>
