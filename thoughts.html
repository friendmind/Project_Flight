            To start off, I just want to say I am not looking for you to reach out to me.</span>
            That is not the reason I am making this. You just happen to be the only person that has showed interest in this
            type of thing so it seemed right to send this your way. I mean I made this with you in mind so as you can assume not anyone can see it. 
            But still, if I didn't think you would enjoy this type of thing I would not have created this and sent it your way.

                With everything I have done and am doing, I'm sure you think I am crazy.
                I mean I am even shocked at the speed I came in and messed things up. Like I broke my own record
                with this. Which is not a good thing. 
                <br><br>
                I laugh at myself now for how I handled the 
                situation but at the time it was a big deal. I did lose it a bit but I needed a reality check and I got it. I think you shouldn't have been the one to have
                given it to me considering what you were going through. But it is what it is right?
                <br><br>
                You know I wondered what crossed your mind with the whole ordeal. You must have thought you've really lucked out with me. 
                Like I'm sure you did not expect me to be like this at all. Or maybe you did. Maybe you had a hunch.

                I mean I have no idea what I would have thought or felt if I were in your shoes as I have not been in the receiving end.
                I'm sure it was something.

            <p class="all_par thoughts_par thoughts_par2">
                Despite not knowing what you think of me I've learned to be okay with that. I don't know what exactly how I made you feel with what I did but 
                I am okay with not knowing. I will not always have the answers to the questions I have. And that is okay.

                    I mentioned I am self-aware of myself. I saw what I did and knew I messed up and I tried to 
                    make up for it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I had learned that sometimes trying and not leaving things as they are is not the only choice we have.
                    We have the opportunity to change things. To try and fix things. Things are not definitive unless we let them be.
                    It all comes down to acting. We don't need to sit around and ponder about things, about the what ifs when we can simply act
                    and see what happens. I mean the worst thing that can happen by trying is you're left with feeling embarrassed or whatever.
                <br><br>
                    As I mention previously, I kind of spiraled. But I am fine now. We sometimes
                    need to experience these things to be able to challenge ourselves.  
                    <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I hate that it really took this to reel me back into reality.">
                    For us to learn how to navigate through certain things without losing ourselves.</span> 
                    You know I am down to mess up somewhere. I'm not perfect after all. Nothing justifies what I do or say but I do learn
                    and I try to do better.
