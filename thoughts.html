            <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="If you want to reach out to me, I am here.">
            To start off, I just want to say I am not looking for you to reach out to me.</span>
            That is not the reason I have made this. You just happen to be the only person that has showed interest in this
            type of thing so it seemed right to send this your way. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I did end up sending my second sister some snippets of what I was achieving and all she would reply back with was a laughing emoji or a shocked emoji&#128514;">I mean I did make this with you in mind so as you can assume 
            not anyone can see it.</span>
            But still, if I didn't think you would enjoy this type of thing I would not have created this and sent it your way. 
            <br><br>
            So this page is similar to the last one as it revolves around my thoughts regarding everything that has happened. Don't worry though 
            it is different. These thoughts are derived from putting myself in your shoes and the way I saw and see things. Also, the tone here is different and I made sure everything here is reasonable and not me venting. So don't worry, 
            you won't come across something uncalled for. Also, just know this is the only time I will touch on the ordeal in this website. So you can proceed 
            without worry.

                With everything I have done and am doing, I'm sure you think I am crazy. Like I'm sure you did not expect me to be like this at all. Or maybe you did. Maybe you had a hunch.
                Who knows.
                <br><br>
                The previous website I am sure was a lot. Again, most likely only adding to your plate. You must 
                have thought, "Damn I can't catch a break&#128514;" Or maybe you could have cared less. I don't 
                know. <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I'm still working on not getting caught into that. It's hard at times but I'm doing surprisingly well now. A small break through.">That is the thing with not knowing.</span> 
                
                <br><br>
                    You might see everything you have experienced the last couple weeks as new lore.
                    Experiences for your new character arc. You might be laughing at the absurdity of all this. 
                    You might think I'm doing too much. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not? I don't know. 
                <br><br>
                Whatever thoughts or feelings derived from what I have done or am doing, are probably reasonable thoughts and feelings. 
                The decisions you have made, prior to this, were for a reason and I respect them despite not knowing the real reasoning behind them.

                     I sit here and can't help but wonder how different things would be if I were just normal. Like 
                    why am I like this. I mean I know why but still&#128514; Like we could have avoided all this if I had just 
                    not made it about me. If I hadn't gotten caught up with how I felt and fed into the thoughts I was having over everything.                   
                    <br><br>
                    I mentioned in the previous website that I am self-aware of myself. I saw what I did and knew I messed up before you even spoke up. You might have been able to brush it off
                    as you knew I didn't mean it in a bad way but I couldn't. I couldn't bare knowing I made you feel some kind of way.
                    And for that reason I couldn't act like nothing happened and just move on.
                    <br><br>
                    The last website was my way of trying to make up or lessen the damage I had caused. It was
                    a space I created in hopes of clearing whatever was not clear or known. You know, I was afraid of not communicating and 
                    things being left as they were. So I created that website and sent it to you because that was far better than not doing anything at all and letting things play out on 
                    there own. 
                    <br><br>
                   In the end, I really don't know what kind of impact the previous website had on you. I don't know if I only made things worse or weird. What I do know 
                    is that  <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="It hurt seeing you sad. I felt your sadness and it felt like my own. This happens far to often. I try to not treat it as my own. But sometimes it's hard not to. ">
                    you were vunerable</span> and <span class="tooltip_thoughts" title="I know nothing I do and say justifies my actions but I do learn and try to do better.">I was trying to not leave you with what I said.</span>
